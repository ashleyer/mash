# M.A.S.H. 

A computerized version of the popular 80's and 90's game. 
As a new developer, I created M.A.S.H. as my first project submission 
in General Assembly's SEI program. It demonstrates my proficiency in 
basic game development, as its flow of actions can be computerized via
Javascript arrays and functions. Further, as the original game was handwritten 
on notebook paper, it requires a simple overall design, but it still highlights
my abilities in CSS. My other motivation for this creation is my fondness for 
this nostalgic glimpse back to childhood. I am excited for it to serve as a 
reminder of that time, and to make it available 
to everyone in today's wired world.
