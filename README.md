# projectZero--MASH


M.A.S.H.: the late-80's future-telling game played with pen and paper meets the 21st century.


Welcome to a computerized version of the popular 80's and 90's game that once swept sleepovers and playgrounds nationwiode. As a new developer, I created M.A.S.H. as my first project submission in General Assembly's SEI program. It demonstrates my proficiency in basic game development, as its flow of actions can be computerized via Javascript arrays and functions. Further, as the original game was handwritten on notebook paper, it requires a simple overall design that still highlights my CSS ability. On a personal level, I am motivated to create this due to my enjoyment for nostalgic glimpses back to childhood. I am excited for it to serve as a reminder of that, and to make it available to everyone in today's wired-up world.
